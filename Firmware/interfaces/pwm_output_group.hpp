/**
 * @brief Base class for a group of PWM outputs.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 
 *  1. At startup the PWM output is off. For PWM outputs that control power FETs
 *     this usually means that the FETs are off and the outputs are floating.
 * 
 *  2. The application starts the PWM output by calling start() and giving it an
 *     on_update callback. This does not yet enable the PWM outputs immediately.
 * 
 *  3. The PWM output implementation periodically requests duty-cycle settings
 *     from the application by calling on_update(). The frequency of these calls
 *     is implementation specific and need not be equal to the PWM frequency.
 *     The application can either bail out (by returning std::nullopt) or return
 *     an array of per-channel-optional duty-cycle values.
 *     If std::nullopt is returned for any of the channels, that channel is
 *     disabled. Otherwise the duty-cycle must be in [0.0, 1.0].
 *     Note that some implementations require either all or none of the channels
 *     to be disabled.
 * 
 *  4. The PWM output stops if any of the following happens:
 *      - on_update() returns std::nullopt
 *      - on_update() returns float values that are not in [0.0, 1.0]
 *      - stop() is called
